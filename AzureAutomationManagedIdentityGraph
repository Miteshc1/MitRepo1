# This script can be used to setup company name.  It is an example for using an Azure Automation account with the managed identity.
# Make sure the identity has the right roles in Entra ID as specified below.  Note that this script will change the company name so check and use with caution.

# This is a template runbook that allows you to connect to Azure, Entra ID and Exchange Online using the Managed Identity of the Azure Automation Account.
# The Azure Automation Account will need to have a system identity assigned AND be enabled.

# To enable the Automation Account run the line below. Only needs to be done once. 
# $output = Set-AzAutomationAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $automationAccount -AssignSystemIdentity
# $output

# For testing interactively with Graph 
# Connect-Graph -Scopes "User.ReadWrite"

# Latest Modules requried to be installed in Azure Automation - PowerShell v5.1
# Az.ManagedIdentities, Az.Graph, Az.Resources, Az.Accounts

# Automation Account Permissions
# The Automation Account Managed identity will need permissions in the systems you want to interact with e.g.
# Directory reader / Writer role in Entra ID
# Exchange Admin if doing MS Online mailbox work
# Azure Permissions on resources if Azure automation work is required 

# If connecting to Azure and require connection.
